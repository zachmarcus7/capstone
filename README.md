Game is playable here: https://zachmarcus7.github.io/capstone/Builds/

Final Project for Senior Capstone class. It is a Breakout-style game where you can play against a neural network 
that was trained with reinforcement learning to see who can break more bricks and stay alive longer. It features 
different maps, difficulty levels, and play styles.

All of the machine learning agents in the game have learned how to play from scratch, and they've also all been
trained in proportion to their difficulty level. For example, the neural network that was trained for the easy
difficulty level was only trained for 1.5 hours, while the neural network associated with the hard difficutly
trained for 15+ hours.
